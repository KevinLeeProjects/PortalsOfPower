Disclaimer: This is my introduction to Unreal Engine 5 and game development in C++. Therefore, some parts may not be up to standard.
The tutorial level was my introduction to Unreal Engine 5. It may not be up to standard, but that is because I was getting used to the engine and playing around with different ways to accomplish certain functions.

The plugin "GameliftStarter" was taken from here: https://github.com/spayne/gameliftstarterplugin. I, however, have modified the GameLiftOfflineBaseMenu.cpp and aws_backend.py to better fit my game. Specifically, I implemented Firebase Database connections to aws_backend.py so that I would be able to send and retrieve the Rest API invoke url as it was created. I also adjusted the username and password login input to fit my game's login using Firebase.
